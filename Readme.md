## Project Overview

### 1. Fetch historical stock data:

We start by obtaining stock data, which is the raw
material for our analysis.

### 2. Preprocess the data:

Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

### 3. Compute indicators:

Calculate technical indicators that form the basis
of our trading decisions.

### 4. Generate trading signals:

Based on the indicators, determine when to buy or
sell the stock.

### 5. Backtest the strategy:

Simulate trading with historical data to evaluate
the strategy's effectiveness.

### 6. Provide user interface:

Allow users to interact with the system, view results,
and understand how the algorithm works.
